    "## An Implementation of Djikstra's Algorithm to a League of Legends Champion\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the project is to develop a full set of solutions to the Aphelios's rotating weapon system problem. In the end, we will create a table where each weapon state (row index) is paired to each other weapon state AND weapon cycle (column index). The only necessary input will be the network edge list, created separately (see ['Aphelios Network Define.xlsx'](https://github.com/paulsylvia20/Djikstras_Algorithm/blob/main/Aphelios%20Network%20Define.xlsx)). I will assume some basic familiarity with [edge lists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83RbL8n3vYU), however, there are plenty of resources online for those who are unfamiliar.\n",
    "\n",
    "The path finding function maintains three running lists. First, it keeps a tally (dictionary) of all nodes that have been visited so far (visited_nodes). This ensures that when a node and its shortest path are found, the node is never revisited by longer paths. Second, the function maintains a priority list where current paths and their lengths are stored, sorted by length, then expanded to their adjacent nodes (paths). Third is the solutions list where shortest path(s) to a target node along with its length is stored when discovered. This is the final output of the algorithm (solutions).\n",
    "\n",
    "The original Djikstra's algorithm is capable of finding every shortest path from a start node to every other node in the network. However, to keep the code concise, I will run Djikstra's algorithm once for each start-node -> target-node pairing. Future versions might optimize the algorithm by storing all shortest paths to each other node in the network, given a particular start-node, in a single pass."

    "#### Forward Stepping Function Inner\n",
    "This script is layed out like a Russian nesting doll, from the innermost to outerpost part of Djikstra's algorithm. The innermost function, find_next_steps(), takes a path and spits out a list of all edges that would extend the path one step forward. It does this by opening the edges list and finding any of the edges that have the last node in the provided path as a 'Source' node. It eventally returns the edge list, but not before addressing 2 caveats.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Caveat 1* <br>\n",
    "An important element of Djikstra's algorithm is that any nodes stepped-into this way must be marked 'visited.' We accomplish this directly inside of find_next_steps() by examining the output before returning, checking if the \"Target\" to any of the edges are in visited_nodes, removing them if they have, and marking them in visited_nodes if they haven't. We do this because the basic logic ensures that any visited nodes already have a shortest path. Thus, any future attempts to visit this node must involve longer or equal length paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Caveat 2* <br>\n",
    "In the standard algorithm, we would apply this logic by (a) checking whether a \"Target\" node is a member of visited_nodes and, if so, (b) preventing it from ever being visited again. However, the standard algorithm guarantees that we output exactly *one* shortest path for each start_node -> end_node pairing. But we would like to store *all* shortest paths, even if there are two or three of them (i.e., two paths going from start_node to end_node that are equal length). To accomplish this, we instruct the find_next_steps() function to only drop a path if it is in the visited_nodes dictionary AND the current path is longer than the known shortest distance to the start_node. Otherwise, the algorithm proceeds with all equivalent paths traveling together towards end_node. In the end, we will store all equivalent paths as solutions."
